# The-Pink-Castle
My college graduation project, an original idea that explored game design, system coding, and sprite creation -- all made with the help of Gamemaker 2. 

The Pink Castle is a chidlren's game, aimed at children around ten to twelve (and younger, if they have some help to read) to tell a story about forgiveness being an inidivual's choice. It shares a tale where children are taught to evaluate their own feelings when considering forgiveness, rather than the feelings of others, and where there isn't a 'wrong' or 'right' choice. 

It's a top down 2D pixel game with simple WASD/arrow keys to move, E/Enter to interact, and 'F' to full screen. It takes about ten minutes to play if you explore every detail and read the dialouge of every charecter.  

This EXE. file of The Pink Castle has been packaged as an intaller, and should run on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu, but was tested on Windows. 

The project is considered complete and is unlikely to be updated.
